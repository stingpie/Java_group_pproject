## Planning:

1. How did the planning phase help with the coding phase? 
> The planning helped with coding immensely, as our group knew what steps to take before we started coding. Having a plan to follow helped us work in parallel and then simply plug the parts together.
2. What components were necessary to consider once you got into coding that you hadnâ€™t thought about while planning?
> As a team, we hadn't missed any major components. However, we made a few changes to the overall plan which made the code "fit" better, like modifying the TxtLoader class to make it static.

## Working with a partner:

1. What did you like or dislike about working with a partner?
> I enjoyed working with my partners. The main advantage was that it was easier to work and splitting the workload made it easier to finish.
2. How did you work together? (Pair programming, distributed development, a hybrid?)
> Distributed Development, with minor peer review. We used GitHub to collaborate and manage the project.

## Team responsibilities/workload balance:

1. Did both members contribute equally? 
> Yes.
2. Who did what?
> Sophia worked on the `TxtLoader` and `FileGenerator` classes, while I worked on the `TileWalkerRecursive`, `Main`, and `StringToArray` classes. Gabe made the `TxtLoaderInterface`, as well as the `TileStepper` and `TileWalker` classes.
3. Do you have any other comments for me to consider?
> We got a different (more efficient) solution to the example than what the assignment sheet has. I think it's because they used a "greedy" pathfinding algorithim, which doesn't test every possible path.
