## Planning:
  While planning, we decided what basic classes we would need, and Gabe wrote an interface for each class. We ended up using most of those frameworks, though we were able to condense some of the methods into one for ease and efficiency while still keeping the program modular. Planning what components we would need to successfully complete the project was crucial so that we could divide the workload and make sure all of the classes could fit together correctly.
  
## Working with a group:
  I found working with a group while coding quite challenging since I'm so used to doing everything on my own. However, GitHub made everything much, much easier. Because we divided up the workload in a modular way, we were each able to complete our parts and make minor adjustments at the end to make sure everything fit together. 
In the future, I think I'll be much more open to working in groups to code, particularly because using GitHub was such an effective method of collaboration. 

## Team responsibilities/workload balance:
  While Shranav and Gabe divided up the work on the core path-finding algorithm, I created a randomized matrix generator file writer and corresponding file reader. On my part, the code itself was simple, but I had fun learning about randomization. Making sure it fit together with the other classes was my main challenge, though once we clarified our variable and method names with a UML diagram, everything was nice and consistent.
