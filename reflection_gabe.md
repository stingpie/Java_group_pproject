Planning:

I really did the majority of pre-planning for this project. We set up a discord chat to talk about the possibilities for this project, and I started planning from the beginning. I drew a little diagram to illustrate my plan. here: https://imgur.com/a/8ZjQdf6 .  As we talked further and fleshed out the ideas, Sophia proposed we add a random matrix generator. I thought that would be alright. 


Working with a partner:

I found working with my team very easy, but that's probably because my team ended up being just as ambitious as me. We decided to work on the code the next day, but I got bored in the meantime, and ended up just writing a couple interfaces that would be implemented later. The next day, I explained my interfaces, and set up a github repository for the project. 

Team responsibilities/workload balance:

We tried to split up the work as evenly as possible. Since I had already set up the interfaces, Sophia & Shranav worked on most of the other things. Shranav worked on the 'UI' (just made it usable through the command line), and originally planned to work on the pathfinding. Sophia worked on a map generator, a txt loader, and a txt parser. However, due to a miscommunication, Shranav thought I was working on the pathfinding, and I thought Shranav was working on it. I had planned on helping Shrenav implement an A* pathfinder, but that ended up being harder than anticipated. I worked on the first half of the A* algorithm, and Shrenav started to work on trying to make it recursive. Both of these failed, and so Shrenav ended up implementing a greedy pathfinder. 

Ultimately, I think the project went very well. My team had just the right balance of ambition and intuition that I can effectively work with. While we didn't implement that A* pathfinder, I still think the project as a whole was a success.
